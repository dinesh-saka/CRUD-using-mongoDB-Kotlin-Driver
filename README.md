# CRUD using mongoDB Kotlin Driver

The MongoDB Kotlin driver is a language driver designed for server-side programming, allowing seamless interaction with Atlas, a cloud database, while leveraging the Kotlin language paradigm. It's well-suited for developing backend applications, scripts, and more.

This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Kotlin coroutines with MongoDB. The code provides examples of how to connect to a MongoDB database, add new documents, query documents, update documents, and delete documents from a collection.
